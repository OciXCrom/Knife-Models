# Knife Models by OciXCrom: Configuration file #
#==============================================#

# You can add a knife by following this example:
# [Knife Name]
# V_MODEL = location of v_ model
# P_MODEL = location of p_ model

# You don't have to add a p_ or v_ model if the knife doesn't have one.
# You can also add some of the parameters below:

# FLAG = if you want the knife to be for VIP users/admins, enter the flag here
# DEPLOY_SOUND = sound when you deploy the knife
# HIT_SOUND = sound when you hit a player
# HITWALL_SOUND = sound when you hit a wall
# SLASH_SOUND = sound when you swing the knife
# STAB_SOUND = sound when you stab a player
# SELECT_SOUND = sound when you select the knife from the menu

# If you are using OciXCrom's Rank System, the following options are also available:

# LEVEL = required level from the rank system to use the knife
# SHOW_RANK = if set to 1, the rank name will be displayed instead of the level number in the menu

[Default]
V_MODEL = models/v_knife.mdl
